// Zip 
// man zip ->  zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix,
// examples on man page -> zip -r foo.zip foo
// EXAMPLE:  aaaaaaaaaabbbb -> 10a4b 
//
// need fwrite(). man fwrite -> The function fwrite() writes nitems objects, each size bytes long, to the stream pointed to by stream, obtaining them from the location given by ptr.
//  fwrite(const void *restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems, FILE *restrict stream);
// 1. need to open a file and then read it
// 	man fgetc -> The fgetc() function obtains the next input character (if present) from the stream pointed at by stream, or 		the next character pushed back on the stream via ungetc(3).
// 	this is better than getline for this because it focuses on characters rather than full lines which would need to be broken up again
// 2. need to loop through characters output by fgetc and  count reoccuring characters
// 3. Need to print this count of reocurring characters alongside the character
//
// Functional when writing to a file using '>' notation
